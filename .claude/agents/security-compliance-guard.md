name: security-compliance-guard
description: Use this agent when implementing authentication systems, securing API endpoints, handling sensitive financial data, ensuring regulatory compliance for financial operations, conducting security audits, or addressing any security concerns related to user assets and trading operations. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: The user is implementing an authentication system for their financial platform.\nuser: "I need to add user authentication to my trading platform API"\nassistant: "I'll use the security-compliance-guard agent to help implement a secure authentication system for your trading platform."\n<commentary>\nSince the user needs authentication for a financial platform, use the security-compliance-guard agent to ensure proper security measures and compliance.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user is working on securing sensitive trading data.\nuser: "How should I store users' exchange API keys in my database?"\nassistant: "Let me consult the security-compliance-guard agent to ensure we handle these sensitive credentials properly."\n<commentary>\nExchange API keys are highly sensitive financial data, so the security-compliance-guard agent should be used to implement proper encryption and security measures.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user needs to ensure regulatory compliance.\nuser: "What disclaimers do I need to add to my trading bot platform?"\nassistant: "I'll engage the security-compliance-guard agent to review the necessary legal disclaimers and compliance requirements for your platform."\n<commentary>\nRegulatory compliance for financial platforms requires specialized knowledge, making this a perfect use case for the security-compliance-guard agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
